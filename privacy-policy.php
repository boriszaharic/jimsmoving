We will use your personal information only for the particular purpose that you provided it which is to provide our services to you or for a directly related purpose such as required or permitted by law or with your consent. To enable us to provide those services, we will disclose your personal information to those relevant entities which are members of the Jim’s Group Franchising System.</p>

  <p><strong>Direct marketing and your privacy</strong></p>
  <p>From time to time we may use the personal information we collect from you to identify particular JIM’S services which we believe may be of interest to you.

We will always give you a choice to opt out of receiving such information in future.</p>

  <p>From time to time we may use the personal information we collect from you to survey your opinion about our services.

    <li><strong>in the public interest</strong></li>

  <p>Privacy Complaints can be made orally or in writing.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Oral Complaints</strong></li>
    <p>Oral complaints (e.g. complaints over the telephone or in person) can be received by the Chief Operating Officer or his/her delegate (for example, a member of the JIM’S Legal Team) when the complaints are judged by the complainant and the Chief Operating Officer or his/her delegate, as capable of resolution within five working days.

    <li><strong>Time Limit</strong></li>
    <p>We will endeavor to make a decision on all written complaints within 20 working days after the day the complaint was received.
